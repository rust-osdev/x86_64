/// keeps interrupts disabled until after the immediately following

/// two instructions. (One exception to this are non-maskable interrupts; this
/// is explained below.)
///
/// This function is useful to put the CPU to sleep without missing interrupts
/// that occur immediately before the `hlt` instruction:
///
/// ```ignore
/// // there is a race between the check and the `hlt` instruction here:
///
/// if nothing_to_do() {
///     // <- race when the interrupt occurs here
///     x86_64::instructions::hlt(); // wait for the next interrupt
/// }
///
/// // avoid this race by using `enable_and_hlt`:
///
/// x86_64::instructions::interrupts::disable();
/// if nothing_to_do() {
///     // <- no interrupts can occur here (interrupts are disabled)
///     x86_64::instructions::interrupts::enable_and_hlt();
/// }
///
/// ```
///
/// ## Non-maskable Interrupts
///
/// On some processors, the interrupt shadow of `sti` does not apply to
/// non-maskable interrupts (NMIs). This means that an NMI can occur between
/// the `sti` and `hlt` instruction, with the result that the CPU is put to
/// sleep even though a new interrupt occurred.
///
/// To work around this, it is recommended to check in the NMI handler if
/// the interrupt occurred between `sti` and `hlt` instructions. If this is the
/// case, the handler should increase the instruction pointer stored in the
/// interrupt stack frame so that the `hlt` instruction is skipped.
///
/// See <http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1009.2/01406.html> for more
/// information.
