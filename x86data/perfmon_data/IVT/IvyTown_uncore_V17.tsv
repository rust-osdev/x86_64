Unit	EventCode	UMask	EventName	Description	Counter	MSRValue	Filter	Internal
CBO	0x0	0x0	UNC_C_CLOCKTICKS	tbd	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
CBO	0x1f	0x0	UNC_C_COUNTER0_OCCUPANCY	Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbo's 0 counter, this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0.   The filtering available is found in the control register - threshold, invert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effectively monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entry.	1,2,3	0x0	null	0
CBO	0x34	0x11	UNC_C_LLC_LOOKUP.ANY	Counts the number of times the LLC was accessed - this includes code, data, prefetches and hints coming from L2.  This has numerous filters available.  Note the non-standard filtering equation.  This event will count requests that lookup the cache multiple times with multiple increments.  One must ALWAYS set filter mask bit 0 and select a state or states to match.  Otherwise, the event will count nothing.   CBoGlCtrl[22:17] bits correspond to [M'FMESI] state.; Filters for any transaction originating from the IPQ or IRQ.  This does not include lookups originating from the ISMQ.	0,1	0x0	CBoFilter0[23:17]	0

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the 'UP' direction is on the clockwise ring and 'DN' is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.

CBO	0x32	0x4	UNC_C_RxR_IRQ_RETRY.ADDR_CONFLICT	Counts the number of times that a request from the IRQ was retried because of an address match in the TOR.  In order to maintain coherency, requests to the same address are not allowed to pass each other up in the Cbo.  Therefore, if there is an outstanding request to a given address, one cannot issue another request to that address until it is complete.  This comes up most commonly with prefetches.  Outstanding prefetches occasionally will not complete their memory fetch and a demand request to the same address will then sit in the IRQ and get retried until the prefetch fills the data into the LLC.  Therefore, it will not be uncommon to see this case in high bandwidth streaming workloads when the LLC Prefetcher in the core is enabled.	0,1	0x0	null	0
CBO	0x32	0x1	UNC_C_RxR_IRQ_RETRY.ANY	Counts the number of IRQ retries that occur.  Requests from the IRQ are retried if they are rejected from the TOR pipeline for a variety of reasons.

CBO	0x32	0x8	UNC_C_RxR_IRQ_RETRY.RTID	Counts the number of times that requests from the IRQ were retried because there were no RTIDs available.  RTIDs are required after a request misses the LLC and needs to send snoops and/or requests to memory.  If there are no RTIDs available, requests will queue up in the IRQ and retry until one becomes available.  Note that there are multiple RTID pools for the different sockets.  There may be cases where the local RTIDs are all used, but requests destined for remote memory can still acquire an RTID because there are remote RTIDs available.  This event does not provide any filtering for this case.	0,1	0x0	null	0

ISMQ requests generally will not need to retry (or at least ISMQ retries are less common than IRQ retries).  ISMQ requests will retry if they are not able to acquire a needed Egress credit to get onto the ring, or for cache evictions that need to acquire an RTID.  Most ISMQ requests already have an RTID, so eviction retries will be less common here.	0,1	0x0	null	0

This includes requests that reside in the TOR for a short time, such as LLC Hits that do not need to snoop cores or requests that get rejected and have to be retried through one of the ingress queues.  The TOR is more commonly a bottleneck in skews with smaller core counts, where the ratio of RTIDs to TOR entries is larger.  Note that there are reserved TOR entries for various request types, so it is possible that a given request type be blocked with an occupancy that is less than 20.

If, for example, one wanted to count DRD Local Misses, one should select 'MISS_OPC_MATCH' and set Cn_MSR_PMON_BOX_FILTER.opc to DRD (0x182); All valid TOR entries.  This includes requests that reside in the TOR for a short time, such as LLC Hits that do not need to snoop cores or requests that get rejected and have to be retried through one of the ingress queues.  The TOR is more commonly a bottleneck in skews with smaller core counts, where the ratio of RTIDs to TOR entries is larger.  Note that there are reserved TOR entries for various request types, so it is possible that a given request type be blocked with an occupancy that is less than 20.  Also note that generally requests will not be able to arbitrate into the TOR pipeline if there are no available TOR slots.	0	0x0	null	0

QPI LL	0x12	0x0	UNC_Q_L1_POWER_CYCLES	Number of QPI qfclk cycles spent in L1 power mode.  L1 is a mode that totally shuts down a QPI link.  Use edge detect to count the number of instances when the QPI link entered L1.  Link power states are per link and per direction, so for example the Tx direction could be in one state while Rx was in another. Because L1 totally shuts down the link, it takes a good amount of time to exit this mode.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
QPI LL	0x10	0x0	UNC_Q_RxL0P_POWER_CYCLES	Number of QPI qfclk cycles spent in L0p power mode.  L0p is a mode where we disable 1/2 of the QPI lanes, decreasing our bandwidth in order to save power.  It increases snoop and data transfer latencies and decreases overall bandwidth.  This mode can be very useful in NUMA optimized workloads that largely only utilize QPI for snoops and their responses.  Use edge detect to count the number of instances when the QPI link entered L0p.  Link power states are per link and per direction, so for example the Tx direction could be in one state while Rx was in another.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

Use edge detect to count the number of instances that the link entered L0.  Link power states are per link and per direction, so for example the Tx direction could be in one state while Rx was in another.  The phy layer  sometimes leaves L0 for training, which will not be captured by this event.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
QPI LL	0x9	0x0	UNC_Q_RxL_BYPASSED	Counts the number of times that an incoming flit was able to bypass the flit buffer and pass directly across the BGF and into the Egress.  This is a latency optimization, and should generally be the common case.  If this value is less than the number of flits transfered, it implies that there was queueing getting onto the ring, and thus the transactions saw higher latency.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
QPI LL	0x3	0x1	UNC_Q_RxL_CRC_ERRORS.LINK_INIT	Number of CRC errors detected in the QPI Agent.  Each QPI flit incorporates 8 bits of CRC for error detection.

Generally, when data is transmitted across QPI, it will bypass the RxQ and pass directly to the ring interface.  If things back up getting transmitted onto the ring, however, it may need to allocate into this buffer, thus increasing the latency.  This event can be used in conjunction with the Flit Buffer Occupancy Accumulator event to calculate the average occupancy.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
QPI LL	0x1	0x2	UNC_Q_RxL_FLITS_G0.DATA	Counts the number of flits received from the QPI Link.  It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each 'flit' is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four 'fits', each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI 'speed' (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the 'transfers' here refer to 'fits'.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 'flit' at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as 'data' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual 'data' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate 'data' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.; Number of data flitsreceived over QPI.  Each flit contains 64b of data.  This includes both DRS and NCB data flits (coherent and non-coherent).  This can be used to calculate the data bandwidth of the QPI link.  One can get a good picture of the QPI-link characteristics by evaluating the protocol flits, data flits, and idle/null flits.  This does not include the header flits that go in data packets.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

To calculate 'data' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.; Number of flits received over QPI that do not hold protocol payload.  When QPI is not in a power saving state, it continuously transmits flits across the link.  When there are no protocol flits to send, it will send IDLE and NULL flits  across.  These flits sometimes do carry a payload, such as credit returns, but are generall not considered part of the QPI bandwidth.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
QPI LL	0x1	0x4	UNC_Q_RxL_FLITS_G0.NON_DATA	Counts the number of flits received from the QPI Link.  It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.

To calculate 'data' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.; Number of non-NULL non-data flits received across QPI.  This basically tracks the protocol overhead on the QPI link.  One can get a good picture of the QPI-link characteristics by evaluating the protocol flits, data flits, and idle/null flits.  This includes the header flits for data packets.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four 'fits', each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI 'speed' (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the 'transfers' here refer to 'fits'.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 'flit' at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as 'data' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual 'data' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate 'data' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.; Number of Non-Coherent Bypass flits.  These packets are generally used to transmit non-coherent data across QPI.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	1

Each 'flit' is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four 'fits', each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI 'speed' (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the 'transfers' here refer to 'fits'.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 'flit' at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as 'data' bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual 'data' and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate 'data' bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.; Number of data flits transmitted over QPI.  Each flit contains 64b of data.  This includes both DRS and NCB data flits (coherent and non-coherent).  This can be used to calculate the data bandwidth of the QPI link.  One can get a good picture of the QPI-link characteristics by evaluating the protocol flits, data flits, and idle/null flits.  This does not include the header flits that go in data packets.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

This basically tracks the protocol overhead on the QPI link.  One can get a good picture of the QPI-link characteristics by evaluating the protocol flits, data flits, and idle/null flits.

HA	0x3	0x0	UNC_H_TRACKER_CYCLES_NE	Counts the number of cycles when the local HA tracker pool is not empty.  This can be used with edge detect to identify the number of situations when the pool became empty.  This should not be confused with RTID credit usage -- which must be tracked inside each cbo individually -- but represents the actual tracker buffer structure.  In other words, this buffer could be completely empty, but there may still be credits in use by the CBos.  This stat can be used in conjunction with the occupancy accumulation stat in order to calculate average queue occpancy.  HA trackers are allocated as soon as a request enters the HA if an HT (Home Tracker) entry is available and is released after the snoop response and data return (or post in the case of a write) and the response is returned on the ring.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

iMC	0x9	0x0	UNC_M_ECC_CORRECTABLE_ERRORS	Counts the number of ECC errors detected and corrected by the iMC on this channel.  This counter is only useful with ECC DRAM devices.  This count will increment one time for each correction regardless of the number of bits corrected.  The iMC can correct up to 4 bit errors in independent channel mode and 8 bit erros in lockstep mode.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
iMC	0x7	0x8	UNC_M_MAJOR_MODES.ISOCH	Counts the total number of cycles spent in a major mode (selected by a filter) on the given channel.   Major modea are channel-wide, and not a per-rank (or dimm or bank) mode.; We group these two modes together so that we can use four counters to track each of the major modes at one time.  These major modes are used whenever there is an ISOCH txn in the memory controller.  In these mode, only ISOCH transactions are processed.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

Regular reads and writes are blocked and only underfill reads will be processed.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
iMC	0x7	0x1	UNC_M_MAJOR_MODES.READ	Counts the total number of cycles spent in a major mode (selected by a filter) on the given channel.   Major modea are channel-wide, and not a per-rank (or dimm or bank) mode.; Read Major Mode is the default mode for the iMC, as reads are generally more critical to forward progress than writes.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
iMC	0x7	0x2	UNC_M_MAJOR_MODES.WRITE	Counts the total number of cycles spent in a major mode (selected by a filter) on the given channel.   Major modea are channel-wide, and not a per-rank (or dimm or bank) mode.; This mode is triggered when the WPQ hits high occupancy and causes writes to be higher priority than reads.  This can cause blips in the available read bandwidth in the system and temporarily increase read latencies in order to achieve better bus utilizations and higher bandwidth.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.

For example, the PCU may ask the iMC to enter self-refresh even though some of the cores are still processing.  One use of this is for Monroe technology.  Self-refresh is required during package C3 and C6, but there is no clock in the iMC at this time, so it is not possible to count these cases.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

This can then be used to calculate the average occupancy (in conjunction with the Read Pending Queue Occupancy count).  The RPQ is used to schedule reads out to the memory controller and to track the requests.  Requests allocate into the RPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.

When the WPQ is full, the HA will not be able to issue any additional read requests into the iMC.  This count should be similar count in the HA which tracks the number of cycles that the HA has no WPQ credits, just somewhat smaller to account for the credit return overhead.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0
iMC	0x21	0x0	UNC_M_WPQ_CYCLES_NE	Counts the number of cycles that the Write Pending Queue is not empty.  This can then be used to calculate the average queue occupancy (in conjunction with the WPQ Occupancy Accumulation count).  The WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and to track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They deallocate after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as soon they have 'posted' to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average latency for this queue is actually not useful for deconstruction intermediate write latencies.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

Before a read or a write is issued, it will first CAM the WPQ to see if there is a write pending to that address.  When reads hit, they are able to directly pull their data from the WPQ instead of going to memory.  Writes that hit will overwrite the existing data.  Partial writes that hit will not need to do underfill reads and will simply update their relevant sections.	0,1,2,3	0x0	null	0

CBO	0x1B	0x3	UNC_C_RING_AD_USED.CW	Counts the number of cycles that the AD ring is being used at this ring stop.  This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the 'UP' direction is on the clockwise ring and 'DN' is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.	2,3	0	null	0
